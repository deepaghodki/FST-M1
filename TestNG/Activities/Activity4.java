/*Logging
In a Selenium test, we need information that helps the users to understand the test steps or any failure during the test case execution.
Logging is very important to any application. It helps us collect information about how the application is running and also helps us debug if any failure occurs.

There are two types of logging in Selenium, Low Level Logging and High Level Logging.
In Low Level Logging you try to produce logs for the every step you take or every action you make in your automation script.
In High Level Logging you just try to capture main events of your test.

@Test
public void main() {

    driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys("User1");
    Reporter.log("Typing in Username");

    driver.findElement(By.id("password")).sendKeys("Test@123");
    Reporter.log("Typing in Password");

    driver.findElement(By.id("submitButton")).click();
    Reporter.log("Logging in");

    Reporter.log("Login successful.");

    driver.findElement(By.id("logoutButton")).click();
    Reporter.log("Loggin out");
}
